🛡️ ForensicVault – Digital Forensics Toolkit
A high-fidelity UI prototype for a cybercrime investigation and evidence management platform.

📖 Overview
ForensicVault is a modern, web-based interface designed for digital forensic investigators. It simulates the workflow of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on digital evidence from compromised systems. The design focuses on a "dark mode" law-enforcement aesthetic, prioritizing clarity, data visualization, and chain-of-custody integrity.

Note: This is a frontend prototype demonstrating UX/UI concepts for cybersecurity tools. It does not perform actual disk imaging or memory analysis.

✨ Key Features
dashboard: Centralized case overview with active alerts and integrity status.

Evidence Collection: UI for disk imaging, memory capture, and hashing (SHA-256).

Multi-Platform Modules: Dedicated views for Windows (Registry/Logs), Linux (Bash/Auth), Android (SMS/Location), and Cloud (AWS CloudTrail).

Analysis & Search: Simulated keyword search, file carving, and artifact filtering.

Event Reconstruction: Interactive timeline visualizing the attack sequence.

Chain of Custody: Blockchain-styled audit trail to demonstrate evidence integrity.

Reporting: Automated report generation preview with export options.
